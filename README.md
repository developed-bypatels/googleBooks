# Description
I am using Google Books Web API Browser with a Database, Navigation Drawer, Notifications and ListViews. The user will be able to select a Home button and About button from Navigation Drawer. On clicking Home button from Navigation drawer, it would allow user to search Books using book title and/or author of the book. And, “About button” will explain about Google Books Web API.

# ListView Prototype
ListViews Prototype in Figure 2 show how the book will be listed when user clicks on “Search Related Books” in Figure 1. Each book instance will have Small Thumbnail Image, Book Title, Book Author, Publisher and Publication date. And, on clicking either one of them it would open Book Details page which Figure 3.
